# 
# The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally
# amidated is always directly followed [1,2] by a glycine residue which provides
# the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
# (Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
# site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
# such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
# Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
# occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.
